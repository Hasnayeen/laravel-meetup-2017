## Write Your Application Story

This repo contains a laravel application with slides and code for my "Laravel Meetup 1.0" presentation. This present shows a basic TDD approach for beginners.

## How to use

Install the application in your local machine like regular laravel application. There are two branch - `presentation` and `dev`. The `presentation` branch contains only slides and `dev` branch contains both slides and code from slides. All the slides are accessible via `pages` (e.g http://localhost/pages/1)  route of the application. Use the `presentation` branch and follow along with the slides and code accordingly. You can also check `dev` branch for final states of the code.

> `N.B` install npm dependencies in `dev` and `presentation` branch
